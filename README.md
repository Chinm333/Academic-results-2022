# Academic-results-2022
Made the project using Python and with the help of csv module 
I am working at a project that has just been granted a contract for building
a teacher’s admin tool for the local high school! I am working on the dashboard for the
school principal.
One specific feature of the client was to be able to quickly generate and visualize
report cards from .csv files containing the student courses and grades. I am parsing .csv files and working with JSON data that is already
processed.
I have build a tool that reads these .csv files, parses them,
calculates the students’ final grades and generates the report as a structured JSON file
that can easily be consumed.
I have easy to read the results in text(.txt) file than csv files.
This program will help you to publish results from different csv files and publish the result in text format which would make easy to read to an non-Tech individual too.
