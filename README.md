USing Python and csv module read 4 csv file published the result in text(.txt) file I am working at a project that has just been granted a contract for building a teacher’s admin tool for the local high school! and my job is working on the dashboard for the school principal. One specific feature the client wanted was to be able to quickly generate and visualize report cards from .csv files containing the student courses and grades. I am parsing .csv files and working with JSON data that is already processed. I have build a tool that reads these .csv files, parses them,calculates the students’ final grades and generates the report as a structured JSON file that can easily be consumed by the front-end. I have made the data available in txt file which can be read by anyone and easy to understand for non-Tech individual. 
Thank you❤️
